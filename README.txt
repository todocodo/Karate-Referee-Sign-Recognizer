Karate Referee Signal Detection using Mediapipe and OpenCV

Author - Todor Ranchev 

What does the system do:
The system is capable of precisely recognising the sports referee's signals in real-time using an AI-based software and a camera and updating the scoreboard automatically. That way, the need for a human operator to update the scoreboard is eliminated, which reduces the human factor as well as the subjectivity in sports. The goal is to make the sport fairer. 

Software: 

	- Python 3.8 or later version
	- Anaconda (optional)
	- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

	A software which can read ipynb files - for example (jupyter notebook, google colab)
	
	All libraries are listed in the notebook files together with some instructions

Hardware:

	- Camera - either the integrated camera if you are using a laptop or just a regualr one. 

ATTENTION !!! 

	Run the the "Main_Notebook.ipynb" first as the pre-trained model is already provided in the folder


Follow the instructions in the notebooks and enjoy !! :D
